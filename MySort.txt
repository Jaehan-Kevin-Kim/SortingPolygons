The additional Sorting Algorithm we chose is the Heap Sort. 
Heap Sort is comparison based and it's similar to Selection Sort. Heap Sort builds a heap
from the input array, and separates the heap into sorted and unsorted heaps. Then it 
takes the largest value from the unsorted heap and places it in the sorted heap, shrinking
the size of the unsorted heap by 1 until completion.
